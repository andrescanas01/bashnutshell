# Nutshell
Andres Canas

## Description
The purpose of this project is to create a bash-like shell using lex and yacc. The project uses FLEX and BISON implementation. The shell is unix based. It never quits unless the command 'bye' is inputted. 


## Design	
This shell system is designed using C. The two main modules are the scanner (nutshscanner.l) and the parser (nutshparser.y). The scanner reads and tokenizes the text. The parser structures the shell language to make sense of the tokens. Recursion is used in the parser to understand the variable number of arguments common to any shell. A global.h file is used to store variables, commands, and paths available to all shell files.

This code uses a combination of forking, piping, and the exec system call to run the main powerhouse of the shell. All inputted non-built-in commands , with file I/O, if any, are stored in a command table (struct in global.h) and then passed through a loop of pipes to exexcve.


## Verification
This project contains a make file which can be used to build the flex and bison files, as well as the executable program ‘nutshell.’ Make clean and make can be used to easily rebuild the program after adjustments are made to the code. ./nutshell will start your shell. Or run the command from any directory!


## Project Breakdown
This shell can be run within your shell and has the following completed features:
  
built in commands - alias, setenv, printenv, unalias, unsetenv.\
Alias expansion.\
Error Handling in circular expansions for Alias\
Environment variable expansion.\
Error handling\
Non-built in commands with any variable number of arguments - executable commands available in your path.\
Searching commands in path environment variable\
IO output redirection.\
IO input redirection.\
Multiple Pipes in Command Line Input\
Multiple Pipes with File I\O Output\
Overwrite vs Append Output\


## Non-completed Features 
Wild card matching\
Redirect Standard Error to Output File\
& functionality for background process running\

## Bugs
Bug when attempting to expand a variable with a string quotation. Faulty but functional.
